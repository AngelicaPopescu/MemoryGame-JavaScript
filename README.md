# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game built using JavaScript. The game displays a grid of cards, each with a hidden icon. The player must click on cards to reveal their icons and match pairs of cards until all cards have been matched.

### Getting Started
To run the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

### How to Play
- Click on a card to reveal its icon
- Click on another card to reveal its icon
- If the icons on the two cards match, the cards will stay revealed and you can continue matching
- If the icons on the two cards do not match, they will be hidden again and you must try again
- Continue matching pairs of cards until all cards have been matched

## This game was my first project using JavaScript. Good luck and have fun playing the Memory game!
